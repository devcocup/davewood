This repo was built using [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

# Editing The Site

The actual site is contained in the `src` folder above. When you open that folder you'll see 6 additional folders - `components`, `data`, `img`, `pages`, `templates` and `utils`.

### Components

These are the building blocks of the site. Things like the Header, Footer and Social Media links are in this folder. There's only a small chance you'll need to change anything in this folder.

### Data

This folder is essentially worthless and should be deleted. Ignore it.

### Img

Each of the folders in this folder contain a collection of images used on each page. If you'd like to upload more images, just click the "Upload Files" button at the top right side of the page and import the new files.

### Pages

This folder is exactly what it sounds like. `Index.js` is essentially the "Home Page". The `md` folder within this directory holds each actual page you see on the site. The pages are written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), which is pretty easy to understand once you look at the documentation.

### Templates

This folder has a file that formats how to process the markdown pages. Chances are if you're still reading this, you won't need to edit this file.

### Utils

The file in this folder is the one that designates the theme for the website. Themes are generated by [typography.js](https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/). Themes that have already been installed are commeneted out `//` and can be switched by commenting / uncommenting those lines.
