David is originally from Fremont, but moved to Omaha to pursue a career as an electrician for Omaha Electric. When he's not working or at a Powell family event, there's a good chance that you'll find him in his [basement](/md/Basement) working on a new project.

This site will be updated with new projects as he completes them and a page for submitting requests will be added soon!
